## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Derek

I'm a software developer based in Canada with 7+ years of experience building web applications in startup and SaaS environments. I bring a strong foundation in frontend development, especially with React, and have spent much of my career working full stack on backend systems using Laravel and Django. Recently, I've been expanding into backend JavaScript with Node.js and building developer-focused projects in the Web3 space.
