## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Derek

I'm a frontend-focused developer based in Victoria, BC, with 7+ years of experience building user-facing web apps in startup and SaaS environments. I specialize in clean, scalable React interfaces, and I enjoy working across product, design, and backend teams to build thoughtful, maintainable software.

I'm particularly interested in crypto and Web3 projects, and I'm exploring ways to contribute to developer tools and data products.
